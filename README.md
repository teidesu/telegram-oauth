# telegram-oauth

a very simple and barebones oauth2 identity provider for telegram
primarily for personal use

## limitations

the current implementation has the following limitations:

- only supports one client_id/secret/redirect_uri
- only supports exactly one verification chat

they might be fixed in the future if i have the need to, otherwise feel free to fork (and maybe even PR!)
